To run JDemetra+ the Java RE 8 or higher is needed. Java RE can be downloaded from [Java Web Site](www.java.com/en/download).  

The official release of JDemetra+ is accessible at [https://github.com/jdemetra/jdemetra-app/releases](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdemetra-app/releases). The site presents all available releases packed in zip packages. From the *Latest release* section either choose the Installer appropriate for your Operating System (Windows, Linux, macOS, Solaris) or take the portable zip-file.
The installation process is straightforward and intuitive. for example, when the zip-file is chosen and download, then under Windows OS the application can be found in the "bin"-folder of the installation/unpacked zip. To open an application, double click on nbdemetra.exe or nbdemetra64.exe depending on the system version (nbdemetra.exe for the 32-bit system version and nbdemetra64.exe for the 64-bit system version).
